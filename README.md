# Mental-Rotation-Stimuli
Python code for generating cube and sphere stimuli for a mental rotation task.

Code need to be ran by order indicated by the numbering of each .py file name:

- Step1: 01_convertShapes.py process file Shapes.csv to output the coordinates of all shapes needed in the task.

- Step2: Use 02_drawCubes.py or 02_drawSpheres.py to produce images of each shape as specified in step 1. Rotation is also completed in this step (rotation interval can be adjusted if - needed). 

- Step3: This step is to remove the background of all images and crop off empty spaces.

For example stimuli, see Example_Cube.png and Example_Sphere.png.
